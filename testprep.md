### 1. **Benefits**: Automation of certain tasks, Accurate compared to the factor of human error, Fast communication
### **Harmfulness**: Prolonged use can cause poor health, Everyone's information is on the web, less social interaction
### 2. Dopamine issues are a real thing. Some people stick onto and stay on a computer for so long that it becomes attached to them and is one with them. They wire their brain to see the computer as something that gives them happiness leading to depression outside of the computer. Some people get so focused in on obtaining that dopamine and that happy feeling making the computer almost like a drug to them. I have been victim to this my self a couple of times and it isn't good for the mind or the body.

### 1. People empower themselves in a digital world by first having access to the digital world, and then using the information and tools that they have obtained from this digital world to benefit themselves or others.
### 2. Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by obtaining or giving them things that they don't have. You can help supply their needs and offer people feedback and input. Something that I could do at Del Norte HS would be teaching people how to use their current digital world access and expand upon it giving them more knowledge and helping empower in the digital space.
### 3. Yes there are many red tapes and papers blocking off in digital empowerment. Some barriers that exist in Del Norte HS include blocked websites that you can't access without a vpn. Their are papers blocking off digital empowerment everywhere we look, whether it be financial issues, supply and demand, or even when you have access to the digital world there are still some features that are being blocked off, for example what I said earlier with DNHS blocking off certain sites.
