[5.1](https://github.com/Isaac-Le/Tri3Repo/blob/main/testprep.md#51-notes), [5.2](https://github.com/Isaac-Le/Tri3Repo/blob/main/testprep.md#52-notes), [5.3](https://github.com/Isaac-Le/Tri3Repo/blob/main/testprep.md#53-notes), [5.4](https://github.com/Isaac-Le/Tri3Repo/blob/main/testprep.md#54-notes)

## 5.1 Notes

* Accelerometer used in Wiis, iPhones, Drones, automobiles, etc.
* Multirotor
  * Benefits - Deliveries, finding lost people, aerial photography is easy
  * Harmful - Flying in unregulated zones is illegal and dangerous, privacy concerns 
* Wii controller
  * Benefits - Gets people active playing video games
  * Harmful - Broken TV’s and injuries
* 3D Printers
  * Open-source software for the computer and printer
  * In schools and homes
  * Special 3D printers can make
    * Organs/Prosthetics
    * Houses
    * Shoes and jewelry
    * Themselves

* In first System the user hears the lists of departments and selects one on their phone which can lead to error
* In second system the customer describes the issue, while the system tries to identify the issue, so we can assume it will work as intended unless stated otherwise

5.1 Video 2: Beneficial and Harmful Effects

Ex:
* The Internet - Originally for Scientists
  * Many people now spend more time on internet and sleeping
  * What if you didn’t have the WWW
  * Dopamine feedback loops, is you trying to seek out that sense of happiness and pleasure, but it can lead to sleep deprivation, depression, anxiety, impulsivity, etc.
* Microtransactions
  * “Free” Games/Apps
  * Cosmetics, paywall to functionality, sometimes pay-to-win
  * Gold, V-bucks, coins, “chips”, SBUX
  * Loot Boxes - Banned in some countries

## Github pages action 5.1
### 1. **Benefits**: Automation of certain tasks, Accurate compared to the factor of human error, Fast communication
### **Harmfulness**: Prolonged use can cause poor health, Everyone's information is on the web, less social interaction
### 2. Dopamine issues are a real thing. Some people stick onto and stay on a computer for so long that it becomes attached to them and is one with them. They wire their brain to see the computer as something that gives them happiness leading to depression outside of the computer. Some people get so focused in on obtaining that dopamine and that happy feeling making the computer almost like a drug to them. I have been victim to this my self a couple of times and it isn't good for the mind or the body.
 
## 5.2 Notes

* The digital divide refers to differing access to computing devices and the internet, based on;
  * Socioeconomic
    * How much money comes into the household per year
  * Geographic
    * Depending on your area of residence, ISPs may not provide high speed internet to your home
  * Demographic characteristics
    * Age
      * If you are older, you may not have devices in your household
    * Religion
      * Example: the Amish People

* Some countries
  * Have rural areas where computers are not common
  * Only allow you to visit a limited number of websites
  * The internet is used to protect and advocate for the government
  * High level of surveillance on the internet to protect the government

## Github pages action 5.2
### 1. People empower themselves in a digital world by first having access to the digital world, and then using the information and tools that they have obtained from this digital world to benefit themselves or others.
### 2. Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by obtaining or giving them things that they don't have. You can help supply their needs and offer people feedback and input. Something that I could do at Del Norte HS would be teaching people how to use their current digital world access and expand upon it giving them more knowledge and helping empower in the digital space.
### 3. Yes there are many red tapes and papers blocking off in digital empowerment. Some barriers that exist in Del Norte HS include blocked websites that you can't access without a vpn. Their are papers blocking off digital empowerment everywhere we look, whether it be financial issues, supply and demand, or even when you have access to the digital world there are still some features that are being blocked off, for example what I said earlier with DNHS blocking off certain sites.

## 5.3 Notes

* Bias exists everywhere
  * Bias includes rejecting somebody based on their age, gender, or ethnicity/race because it did not fit your computing model
* Questions to ask about bias
  * Enhancing or intentionally excluding?
  * Intentionally harmful/hateful?
  * Receiving feedback from a wide variety of people?

## Github pages action 5.3
### 1. The owner of the computer does not think that this is intentional
### 2. No because he seems to be joking about it and doesn't seemed to angered about it
### 3. This probably happened because when making the program or system they didn't have or test it anyone that is Black which is why they didn't see the fault in the program
### 4. This is harmful to some people because they can see it as the computer companies not caring or thinking about people other than people that are White, and while I don't think it was intended it could still cause issues
### 5. Yes the program should be corrected
### 6. Think about all the bias's that could occur inside of a group and try to stop any problems before they start

## 5.4 Notes
* Distributive computing
  * Use it to compute faster
* Citizen science
  * Giving citizens control of scientific research as long as it isn’t too demanding so the actual scientists can collect the data and use it
* Crowdsourcing
  * Gaining information and data by obtaining the services of a large group of people 

## Github pages action 5.4
### 1. A crowdsource idea in our enviornment could be a poll on whether or not you find CompSci hard to learn or not and we can collect that data and see how many people find learning CompSci easy and how many find it hard to learn CompSci
### 2. For Del Norte we could have a poll asking people about there input on who finds school easy and who finds school difficult. Yes our project could be better with crowdsourcing because with croud sourcing we are able to get feedback from many sources if we give it out to the public to test out

## 5.5 Notes
* Intellectual Property (IP) - One has rights of creation and invention from creativity
* Copyrights protect your IP
  * People can't use it without permission from you so people don't plagiarise  
* Legal ways of using things
  * Open Source
  * Creative Commons
    * Gives free licenses that tell you what you can and can't do with the IP 
  * Open Access
    * No restrictions and no copyright laws or licenses restricting them
* Digital Devide
  * Unequal access to technology

## Github pages Action 5.5
### 1. License Type Notes
* Creative Commons is good for projects where you don't care how people use your project
* Open Source MIT is good for projects where you can freely use code and distribute closed versions
* Open Source GPL is good for projects where others can use your code but not distribute closed versions
### 2. License Choice
* My group picked the MIT license because the only condistions are that we must disclose the license and copyright info when we distribute the website, so we don't have many restrictions allowing us to do much more with our project.

## 5.6 Notes
* Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
  * SSN
  * Race
  * Age
  * Email
  * Phone Number
* Should not be given to everybody, only trusted sites/individuals
* Search Engines record the history of what you have browsed
* PII can help enhance a person's experience with a website, however it could also be harmful
* Info is hard to delete as it is often saved somewhere that we can't access
* Multi Factor Authentication
  * Two way Factor Authentication through email, text, etc.
* Malware
  * Damages a computer by taking it over
* Encryption helps stop and prevent unauthorized access and there are different tupes of keys
  * Symmetric 
    * A single key used to encrypt and decrypt data
  * Asymmetric (Public Key Encryption)
    * Two different keys
    * Public for encrypting
    * Private for decrypting
* Degital Certificate
  * Validates someones ownership of encryption keys
* Phishing
  * A way that people are trciked into giving away personal information often through a malware that will takeover your PC
    * Keylogger
      * That record what keys you press to gain PIIs
    * Rogue Access Point
      * Wireless network points that give unauthroized access to secure networks

## Github pages Action 5.6
### 1. Some PII's that I have seen on projects in CompSci Principles include my github account, pictures of myself, as well as my name.
### 2. PII isn't a bad thing because your information needs to be out there if peoeple want to contact you such as jobs. However there are still downsides and you need to protect your PII's from landing in the wrong hands because that could lead to conflicting issues.
### 3. A Good password has a mix of characters, both uper and lowercase, symbols, and numbers. Bad passwords will be something that have a connection to your PII's especially if they are repetitive and used often. Another step that can be used to assist in authentitaciton could be multi factor authentication whether it be sending a code through text or email that you can use to log in.
### 4. Symmetric encryption is one key that all specificed users have that can be used in order to decrypt a message. On the other hand Asymmetric uses a public key for encryption and need a unique private key for decryption (connected mathematically).
### 5. We use HTTPS in our deployment in order to encrypt our websites using a TLS protocol which sends HTTP data and files to the user as encrypted data
### 6. Luckily I have yet to run into a phishing scheme, however I know my sister has fallen for a phishing scheme when she clicked a link which led to a malware being installed into her computer taking down our wifi network. Other examples of phishing techniques include infiltration of networks, fake links, trigger downloads, Emails, etc.
