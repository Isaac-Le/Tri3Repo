# Description
Our create task is a game that will allow the user 5 attempts to guess a country and throughout those 5 attempts will give them 4 hints. After the 5 attempts, the game ends if they didn't guess correctly, however, if there is a correct guess then the game will tell the user that they have won. 
### Features:
* input bar for the guessing of the countries
* A Guess button to send the guess through the system and output correct or incorrect
* A Clear button to clear the input bar of your current guess
* A New button to start a new game with a new country
* 4 hints: 1. The first letter, 2. The last letter, 3. The number of letters, 4. The continent the country is on
* If correct, there will be a popup indicating that the user was correct and telling the user how many attempts it took. If not correct after 5 tries, the popup will tell the user what the answer was. 

The user can test their ability at guessing countries or learn the names of new countries that they'd previously never heard of. 
# Possible Other Ideas
We could add facts about the different countries if you guess the correct and if you guess them wrong at the end of each game so you could be learning something new about the different countries that you are guessing. We could also show an outline of the country, so the user can guess based on that.
